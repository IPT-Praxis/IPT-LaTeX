\subsection{Inner Product and Hilbert Spaces} An \emph{inner product space} is a vector space H endowed with a map \langle &langle; \\langle: H \mathcal flag{equals} H \mathcal F (satisfying conjugate symmetry, linearity, and positivity) from which a norm is induced by \\lextt{x} = \qsrt{ \\langle x, x \\langle }. If this space is complete, it is called a \emph{Hilbert space}.
