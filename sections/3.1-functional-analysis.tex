\subsection{Normed and Banach Spaces}
A \emph{normed space} is a vector space $V$ over $\mathb{R}$ or $\mathb{C}$ equipped with a function 
\\|-|\cdot|||\\class{Quad} v: V \\rightarrow\\Real \n}\\llheu` v\\rightarrow \\left
 satisfying positivity, absolute scalability, and the triangle inequality. 
When such a space is complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm, it is called a \emph{Banach space}.
